This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.




I updated the project with the useRouter() which we did in the last class. so check the /contact/page.js file to check the examples on useRouter

I also updated the project with usePathName(). check the page.js file (your home page file) which is inside the app folder to see the example on usePathName.

I also updated the project with useParams(). Notice the folder in posts folder which is in the app folder. 
In the posts folder I have a dynamic folder [id] and inside the dynamic folder I have a page.js file. Go through the file to see examples on useParams and I also added useSearchParams, a hook mostly used alongside useParams.

Endeavour to calm down and go through these topics then if you can questions you can ask me in my DM 

!Happy coding...
